                                                <p>The Bapuji Institute of Engineering and Technology was established in the academic year 1979-1980 and came in to being on 1st September 1979. Department of Physics, which was one of the very few earliest departments, started functioning on the same day itself with four senior staff from sister institutes as the founder faculty. In the beginning the laboratory facilities of DRM Science College were utilized. In the academic year 1983-84 the independent laboratory was temporarily established in Workshop complex. Later the laboratory was shifted to BIET Boysâ€™ hostel premises. In the year 1986, a complete independent laboratory with all the ultramodern sophisticated equipments and facilities required to train the Engineering students and carry out Research activities was established in the Science and Textile Block I-floor, with a floor area of 2700 Sq.ft. The staff members of the department put hard efforts to train the students, which is very well demonstrated in the overall result in both theory and laboratory subjects. The average result of all these years is more than 95%. The department faculties are actively involved in publishing and presenting research papers in Technical Journals and Conferences of National and International repute. Staff is also involved in research activities leading to Doctoral Degree. Dr. V. Annadurai obtained his Ph.D. from Mysore University and Dr. G.J. Shankaramurthy from Kuvempu University.
