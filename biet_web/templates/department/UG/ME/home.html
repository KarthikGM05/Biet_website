Later, the intake was increased to 120 students on demand from industries and research institutes. Post-graduation curriculum leading to Master's degrees in the area of Machine Design was started in 2002 with the intake of 18 students and Thermal Power Engineering was started in 2010 with the intake of 18 students. The Department is also having Research Centre and Product Development Cell. Department is affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum and is duly approved by Institution of Engineers India Kolkata. Department was duly accredited by National Board of Accreditation, New Delhi Thrice.<br><br> 
Considering the potential and talents available in the department, various state and central government funding agencies like AICTE, DST, FIST, UGC, DBT, ICSSR, VGST, KSCST and KSBDB have extended their financial support to the tune of over 90 lakhs since last four years. Department strives hard for academic excellence through personalized attention with an ideal teacher-student ratio of 1:15. Facultiesâ€™ contribution in research activities are evidenced by their publications of 70 at national and international peer reviewed conferences and journals. At present in the department 24 students have been registered for Ph.D. and are at various stages of their research activities and also 5 students are awarded Ph.D. by VTU.<br><br>
The Department is continuously striving to achieve excellence in education, academic and industry oriented research as well as consultancy work with service to the society. Our research activities are primarily focused on Composites, Alternative fuels, Electronic Engine Management, Fracture Mechanics, Precision Engineering. We aim to provide our students a perfect blend of intellectual and practical experiences, which helps them to serve our society and address a variety of needs. At the end of our program, students are prepared for entry-level work as a mechanical engineer as well as for the post-graduate study in mechanical engineering or in another discipline, where a fundamental engineering background constitutes a desirable foundation. Both undergraduates and postgraduates are well placed in leading industries as well as in the higher research level institutions of international recognition.<br><br>
The Department of Mechanical Engineering, being one of the largest and oldest departments of the Institute, caters to its students with class tutorial and state-of-the-art laboratories. Apart from carrying out practical classes as per academic curriculum, Workshops caters to needs of different departments of the Institute in terms of executing works of their BE, MTech and PhD students as well as other related research works. The Department also welcomes students from other departments of the institute as a gesture of support to their time-to-time academic and research needs.<br> <br>
